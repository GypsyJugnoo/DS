    "SKILLS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language, supporting object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too. You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    ".py, \n",
    "Python file extensions are\n",
    ".py\n",
    ".pyi\n",
    ".pyc\n",
    ".pyd\n",
    ".pyo\n",
    ".pyw\n",
    ".pyz\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?\n",
    "'#' used to give single-line comments in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "The function sys. version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called\n",
    "Python supports to make anonymous functions which are not bound to a name(@ runtime). It uses a construct called \"lambda\" .\n",
    "10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "The standard package manager for Python is pip. PIP stands for Preferred Installer Program, helps you to install libraries and dependencies, that doesn't come with the standard package. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "Python Built-in Functions\n",
    "print( ) function.\n",
    "type( ) function.\n",
    "input( ) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "The following are some of the features in Python that are discussed below:\n",
    "Easy to Code. Python is a very high-level programming language, yet it is effortless to learn. ...\n",
    "Easy to Read. ...\n",
    "Free and Open-Source. ...\n",
    "Robust Standard Library. ...\n",
    "Interpreted. ...\n",
    "Portable. ...\n",
    "Object-Oriented and Procedure-Oriented. ...\n",
    "Extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "How do I Install Python for free on Windows?\n",
    "Step 1 — Downloading the Python Installer\n",
    "Go to the official Python download page for Windows.\n",
    "Find a stable Python 3 release. This tutorial was tested with Python version 3.10. ...\n",
    "Click the appropriate link for your system to download the executable file: Windows installer (64-bit) or Windows installer (32-bit).\n",
    "The complete path of python.exe can be added by\n",
    "\n",
    "Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking on the Environment Variables button o​n the bottom right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can now be used directly from the command prompt without having to write its location. Try executing the command python --version; it will output the version of Python installed on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code."
