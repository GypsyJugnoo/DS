    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, which makes it highly flexible and scalable. MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and can be used for various types of applications, including e-commerce, social media, and IoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use a structured query language (SQL) to manage data. These databases are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, and they can be highly scalable and flexible. Unlike SQL databases, which have a predefined schema, NoSQL databases like MongoDB can store data in a variety of formats, including key-value, document-oriented, graph, and column-family.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for flexible and scalable data storage. This is especially true for applications that require real-time data processing and analysis, such as social media and IoT. MongoDB's ability to handle unstructured and semi-structured data, along with its flexible schema, makes it an ideal choice for these types of applications. Additionally, MongoDB's ability to scale horizontally makes it suitable for applications that require high availability and performance.'''"
