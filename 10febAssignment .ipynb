    "#Q1. Which function is used to open a file? \n",
    "#What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''In Python, the open() function is used to open a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function takes two arguments: the name of the file to be opened (including the path, \n",
    "if the file is not in the current directory), and the mode in which the file is to be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the different modes of opening a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' mode (read-only): This is the default mode for opening a file. In this mode, \n",
    "you can only read the contents of the file but cannot modify it. If the file does not exist, \n",
    "an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' mode (write-only): In this mode, you can only write to the file and cannot read from it. \n",
    "If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, \n",
    "its contents will be truncated (i.e., deleted) before writing to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' mode (append-only): In this mode, you can only write to the file and cannot read from it. \n",
    "If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists,\n",
    "new data will be appended to the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' mode (exclusive creation): In this mode, \n",
    "you can only write to the file and cannot read from it. \n",
    "If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' mode (binary mode): This mode is used when working with binary files (e.g., images, audio files, etc.).\n",
    "It can be used with any of the above modes by adding the 'b' character to the mode string.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' mode (text mode): This mode is used when working with text files (e.g., .txt files).\n",
    "It can be used with any of the above modes by adding the 't' character to the mode string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of opening a file in write mode:\n",
    "In this example, we open the file 'myfile.txt' in write mode using the open() function with the mode 'w'. \n",
    "We then write the text 'This is a line of text' to the file using the write() method of the file object. \n",
    "Finally, we close the file using the close() method of the file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is good practice to close the file after using it to ensure that\n",
    "all the data is saved to the file and that system resources are freed up.'''\n",
